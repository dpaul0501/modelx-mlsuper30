# 🎯 ModelX ML Bootcamp – Week 2 (Part 1): Recommendation Systems – Rule-Based & Collaborative Filtering

Welcome to **Week 2 – Part 1** of the **ModelX ML Bootcamp**.  
This week kicks off our journey into **Recommendation Systems**, focusing on foundational methods that power real-world platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify.

---

## 📘 Covered in This Session

We introduced the classical building blocks of recommender systems based on:

📚 **Mining of Massive Datasets (MMDS)** – Chapter on Recommender Systems  
🔗 *Textbook Link*: http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/book.pdf

🔍 **Main Topics**:
- **Rule-Based Models**
  - *Popularity-based Recommendations*: What’s trending overall?
- **Collaborative Filtering (Memory-Based)**
  - *User-User Similarity*: Find users with similar tastes
  - *Item-Item Similarity*: Recommend based on items the user liked

🧪 **Hands-on Demo** (Kaggle):  
We explored this [MovieLens notebook using the Surprise library](https://www.kaggle.com/code/stpeteishii/movielens-recommendation-surprise)  
It demonstrates user-user and item-item collaborative filtering using real data.

## 🔜 Coming Up in Part 2

In the next session, we’ll dive into:
- **Matrix Factorization with SVD**
- **Latent Representations for Users and Items**
- **Cold Start Challenges and Hybrid Methods**

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Rule-based and memory-based recommenders are intuitive and interpretable.
- Similarity metrics (cosine, Pearson) are core to collaborative filtering.
- Real datasets (like MovieLens) help validate performance and intuition.

Stay curious and keep building! 🚀
